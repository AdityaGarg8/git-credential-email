# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important. The credential helpers do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to any external servers owned by me.

## 1. Local Storage Only

All data (including refresh token and access token) is stored locally on your device. I do not have access to this data.

## 2. Third-Party Services

The credential helpers connect directly to the email provider for which they are made to provide email functionality. Your data is processed by those services according to their respective privacy policies.

I do not monitor, log, or access your email accounts or any related information.

## 3. No Analytics or Tracking

I do not use any analytics tools or third-party tracking services.

## 4. Permissions

The credential helpers may request permissions (e.g., keychain access, network access) solely for the purpose of retrieving and storing OAuth2.0 tokens. These permissions are not used to collect personal data.

## 5. Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, feel free to contact me at: **gargaditya08@live.com**
